### [x] Milestone M20: Project List & Search (v0.19.0)
**Goal**: Add comprehensive project listing with intelligent defaults, extensive filtering matching all create/update fields, multiple output formats, and refactor project command structure for consistency

#### Key Design Decisions
- ✅ Single `project list` command with `--search` flag (no separate search command)
- ✅ Smart defaults: auto-filter by config defaults (team, initiative) + projects where current user is **lead**
- ✅ Override flags: `--all-teams`, `--all-initiatives`, `--all-leads` to bypass defaults
- ✅ Comprehensive filters matching all create/update fields (team, initiative, status, priority, lead, member, label, dates)
- ✅ Refactor project commands to match workflow-states/labels pattern
- ❌ `project delete` & `project sync-aliases` - Deferred to M21

#### Field Comparison: Create/Update vs List Filters

| Create/Update Field | List Filter | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| `--team` | `--team` | Filter by team (default from config) |
| `--initiative` | `--initiative` | Filter by initiative (default from config) |
| `--status` | `--status` | Filter by status |
| `--priority` | `--priority` | Filter by priority level |
| `--lead` | `--lead` | Filter by project lead (default: current user) |
| `--members` | `--member` | Filter projects containing this member |
| `--labels` | `--label` | Filter by label |
| `--startDate` | `--start-after`, `--start-before` | Date range filters |
| `--targetDate` | `--target-after`, `--target-before` | Date range filters |
| `--icon` | ❌ (display only) | Show in output, not filterable |
| `--color` | ❌ (display only) | Show in output, not filterable |
| N/A | `--search` | Search title/description/content |
| N/A | `--all-teams` | Override default team filter |
| N/A | `--all-initiatives` | Override default initiative filter |
| N/A | `--all-leads` | Override "lead=me" filter, show all leads |

#### Default Behavior Logic
```bash
# Default: Show projects I LEAD in DEFAULT team/initiative (if configured)
linear-create project list
# → Filters: lead=me + team=defaultTeam + initiative=defaultInitiative

# Override to see ALL projects (any lead) in default team/initiative
linear-create project list --all-leads

# Override to see my led projects across ALL teams
linear-create project list --all-teams

# Filter by specific lead (overrides default)
linear-create project list --lead alice@company.com

# Filter by member (projects where someone is assigned, not necessarily lead)
linear-create project list --member bob

# Complex filter: all projects led by Bob in backend team, started status
linear-create project list --team backend --lead bob --status started

# Override everything - all projects everywhere
linear-create project list --all-teams --all-initiatives --all-leads
```

#### Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- List all projects with smart defaults (lead=currentUser + config defaults)
- Filter by: team, initiative, status, priority, lead, member, label, search query
- Date range filters: start-after/before, target-after/before
- Override flags to bypass defaults: --all-teams, --all-initiatives, --all-leads
- Display columns: ID | Title | Status | Team | Lead | Description/Content Preview
- Content preview: show description if exists, else truncated content (~60 chars, single line)

**Output Formats:**
- Default: Formatted table with aligned columns
- JSON: Machine-readable format (--format json)
- TSV: Tab-separated values for scripting (--format tsv)
- Interactive mode with Ink UI (-I, --interactive)
- Web browser mode (--web)

**Command Refactoring:**
- Extract all project commands to function exports matching workflow-states/labels pattern
- Update cli.ts to use function-based registration
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Out of Scope:**
- `project delete` command - Deferred to M21
- `project sync-aliases` command - Deferred to M21

## [x] Milestone M21: GraphQL Query Optimization (v0.19.1)
**Goal**: Optimize `getAllProjects()` to reduce API calls using conditional fetching and caching, improving performance by 92-98%

#### Key Design Decisions
- ✅ Phase 1: Hybrid GraphQL + SDK approach (75% reduction: 1+N calls)
- ✅ Phase 2 (Extended): Conditional fetching + user caching (92-98% reduction: 1-2 calls total)
- ✅ Current user cached in entity-cache.ts (eliminates repeated user queries)
- ✅ Labels/members only fetched IF used in filters (conditional Query 2)
- ✅ Batch query fetches all labels+members in single API call (not N calls)
- ✅ In-code join merges Query 1 (projects) + Query 2 (labels/members)
- 🔮 Future: Also conditionally fetch based on OUTPUT format needs

#### Problem Statement
Current `getAllProjects()` implementation suffers from N+1 query problem:
- Makes 1 + (4×N) API calls where N = number of projects
- For 100 projects: 401 API calls
- For 500 projects: 2,001 API calls
- Each project requires 4 additional API calls: teams(), lead, labels(), members()

#### Solution
Hybrid approach using raw GraphQL query for most relations, SDK for members:
```graphql
query GetAllProjectsWithRelations($filter: ProjectFilter, $includeArchived: Boolean) {
  projects(filter: $filter, includeArchived: $includeArchived) {
    nodes {
      # Core fields + nested relations (teams, lead, labels)
      # Members fetched separately via SDK to stay under complexity limit
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Hybrid?**
Initial attempt to fetch all 4 nested relations in one query exceeded Linear's complexity limit (10,025 > 10,000).
Removing `members` from GraphQL query keeps complexity under limit while still achieving 75% reduction in API calls.

#### Performance Improvement

**Phase 1 (Hybrid Approach):**
| Projects | Before (API Calls) | Phase 1 (API Calls) | Phase 1 Improvement |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 10       | 41                | 11                  | 73%                 |
| 50       | 201               | 51                  | 75%                 |
| 100      | 401               | 101                 | 75%                 |
| 500      | 2,001             | 501                 | 75%                 |

**Phase 2 Extended (Conditional Fetching + Caching):**
| Projects | Before (API Calls) | Phase 2 (No Filters) | Phase 2 (With Filters) | Phase 2 Improvement |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 10       | 41 (1+1+N)        | 1                    | 2                      | 92-98%              |
| 50       | 201 (1+1+N)       | 1                    | 2                      | 99%                 |
| 100      | 401 (1+1+N)       | 1                    | 2                      | 99.5%               |
| 500      | 2,001 (1+1+N)     | 1                    | 2                      | 99.9%               |

**Key Improvements:**
- **User caching**: Eliminates getCurrentUser() API call across all commands
- **Conditional fetching**: Only fetch labels/members if filters use them
- **Batch query**: Fetch all labels+members in 1 call (not N calls)
- **In-code join**: Merge results client-side for optimal performance

**Additional Benefits:**
- Reduced latency (1-2 round-trips vs N sequential requests)
- Lower risk of rate limiting (99% fewer API calls)
- Reduced server load
- Simpler code (no async loops)
- Better caching strategy

#### Requirements
- Implement raw GraphQL query with nested field selection (hybrid approach)
- Maintain existing filter building logic (no changes needed)
- Pass all existing tests without modification
- No breaking changes to function interface

#### Out of Scope
- Optimization of other API functions (focus on getAllProjects only)
- Query result caching (future enhancement)
- GraphQL query builder abstraction (future enhancement)

## [x] Milestone M23: Project Dependency Management (v0.20.2)
**Goal**: Add comprehensive project dependency management to linear-create CLI, supporting directional dependencies between projects with anchor semantics

#### Key Design Decisions
- ✅ Hybrid approach: dependency flags on create/update commands + dedicated dependency management subcommands
- ✅ Linear API uses `type: "dependency"` with anchor-based semantics (`start`, `end`)
- ✅ Simple mode: `--depends-on` / `--blocks` with sensible defaults (80% use case)
- ✅ Advanced mode: `--dependency "project:anchor:anchor"` for full control
- ✅ No milestone support (project-level only)
- ✅ Bi-directional behavior: NOT automatic (each direction requires separate relation)
- ❌ Milestone-to-milestone dependencies NOT SUPPORTED

#### CLI Design

**Simple Mode (Recommended):**
```bash
# "I depend on X" - My end waits for X's start (end→start)
--depends-on <projects>

# "I block X" - X's end waits for my start (start→end)
--blocks <projects>
```

**Advanced Mode:**
```bash
# Full anchor control
--dependency "project:myAnchor:theirAnchor"

# Examples:
--dependency "api-v2:end:start"    # My end → their start
--dependency "api-v2:start:end"    # My start → their end
--dependency "api-v2:end:end"      # Both ends linked
--dependency "api-v2:start:start"  # Both starts linked
```

#### Requirements
- Support adding/removing "depends on" and "blocks" relations
- Integrate with existing create/update commands (flags)
- Provide dedicated dependency management subcommands (`project dependencies`)
- Display dependencies in view and list commands with ⬅️/➡️ emoji
- Filter projects by dependency status
- Project-level only (no milestone support)
- Self-referential validation (project cannot depend on itself)
- Graceful duplicate handling (let API reject, friendly messages)

#### Out of Scope
- Milestone-to-milestone dependencies (removed from roadmap)
- Dependency validation/cycle detection (Linear API responsibility)
- Gantt chart visualization
- Dependency automation/triggers

### Implementation Notes
- Linear API uses `type: "dependency"` (ONLY valid value)
- Anchor types: `"start"` or `"end"` (NOT "project" or "milestone")
- Bi-directional: NOT automatic (each direction needs separate relation)
- CLI flags: kebab-case (`--depends-on`, `--blocks`)
- Direction values: kebab-case (`depends-on`, `blocks`)
- Default anchors: `--depends-on` = end→start, `--blocks` = start→end
- See DEPENDENCIES.md for complete implementation plan

### Implementation Summary (v0.20.2)

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ Core library functions in linear-client.ts and parsers.ts (Phase 1)
- ✅ Dependency flags on project create/update commands (Phase 2)
- ✅ Dependency display in project view command with ⬅️/➡️ emoji (Phase 2)
- ✅ Four dedicated dependency subcommands: add, remove, list, clear (Phase 3)
- ✅ `project dependencies` (alias: `deps`) subcommand group with comprehensive help
- ✅ `--show-dependencies` flag on project list (opt-in dependency counts) (Phase 4)
- ✅ Self-referential validation (prevents project depending on itself)
- ✅ Graceful duplicate handling
- ✅ Full alias support for all project references
- ✅ Comprehensive test script with 35+ test cases

**What Was Completed in v0.20.3 (Phase 4 Extended):**
- ✅ Dependency filter flags on project list (--has-dependencies, --without-dependencies, --depends-on-others, --blocks-others)
- ✅ Client-side filtering after GraphQL fetch (optimal performance)
- ✅ Conflicting filter validation
- ✅ Fixed: Initialize dependency counts to 0 when fetching (not undefined)
- ✅ Fixed: Renamed --no-dependencies to --without-dependencies (commander.js conflict)

**Files Modified:**
- src/lib/types.ts (ProjectRelation interfaces, includeDependencies flag)
- src/lib/linear-client.ts (createProjectRelation, deleteProjectRelation, getProjectRelations, getAllProjects)
- src/lib/parsers.ts (resolveDependencyProjects, parseAdvancedDependency, validateAnchorType, getRelationDirection)
- src/commands/project/create.tsx (dependency flags, creation logic)
- src/commands/project/update.ts (dependency add/remove logic)
- src/commands/project/view.ts (dependency display section)
- src/commands/project/list.tsx (--show-dependencies flag, conditional fetching)
- src/commands/project/dependencies/*.ts (add, remove, list, clear commands)
- src/cli.ts (dependency subcommand registration)
- tests/scripts/test-project-dependencies.sh (comprehensive integration tests)

**Build Status:** ✅ Passes
**Typecheck Status:** ✅ Passes
**Runtime Tests:** ✅ Manual testing complete, integration test script ready

## [x] Milestone M22: Date Parser Foundation & Unit Tests (v0.21.0)
**Goal**: Implement smart date parsing with flexible input formats (quarters, months, years) and establish comprehensive unit testing infrastructure using Vitest

**Status**: Complete. All phases implemented. Integration tests available but require LINEAR_API_KEY to run.

**Bug Fixes (2025-01-29)**:
- [BUG-UT-001] Added 2 tests for numeric month year validation (1999-01, 2101-12)
- [BUG-UT-002] Added 2 tests for named month year validation (Jan 1999, December 2101)
- [BUG-UT-003] CRITICAL: Added 5 tests for `parseDateForCommand` CLI API (including error handling)
- [BUG-UT-005] Added 2 tests for ISO date regex strictness (2025-01-5, 2025-1-15)
- [BUG-UT-006] Enhanced whitespace error assertion test with message validation
- **Result**: 108 tests (from 97), 100% statement coverage, 99.01% branch coverage

#### Key Design Decisions
- ✅ API testing first approach: Validate Linear's actual date acceptance before implementing parser
- ✅ Vitest for unit testing: Native ESM support, fast, modern test runner
- ✅ Basic formats only (Phase 1): Quarters, months, years, ISO dates
- ✅ Pure function design: No API calls in parser, 100% unit testable
- ❌ Relative shortcuts deferred to M23 (this-quarter, +1q, etc.)
- ❌ Interactive date picker deferred to M23

#### Problem Statement
Current date handling only supports ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Users must manually calculate quarter/month start dates
- No validation in project create command
- Duplicate validation code in update command
- No unit testing infrastructure exists
- DATES.md comprehensive spec (1450 lines) not implemented

#### Solution
Implement smart date parser supporting multiple intuitive formats:
- **Quarters**: `2025-Q1`, `Q1 2025`, `q1-2025` → `2025-01-01` with `resolution: quarter`
- **Half-years**: `2025-H1`, `H1 2025` → `2025-01-01` with `resolution: halfYear`
- **Months**: `2025-01`, `Jan 2025`, `January 2025` → `2025-01-01` with `resolution: month`
- **Years**: `2025` → `2025-01-01` with `resolution: year`
- **ISO dates**: `2025-01-15` → `2025-01-15` with `resolution: undefined`

#### Performance & Testing Benefits
- **100% statement coverage** for date parser (99.01% branch coverage)
- **108 unit tests** covering all formats, edge cases, precedence rules, CLI API
- **No API calls** during parsing (pure functions)
- **Fast test execution** with Vitest (parallel, watch mode)
- **Empirical validation** via API testing script
- **Critical bug fixes**: Added missing tests for CLI API wrapper (`parseDateForCommand`)

#### Requirements
- Test Linear API date acceptance empirically
- Set up Vitest unit testing infrastructure
- Implement date parser with comprehensive format support
- Achieve 100% code coverage for date-parser.ts
- Integrate into project create/update commands
- Extend integration tests with new formats

#### Out of Scope
- Relative date shortcuts (this-quarter, next-month, +1q) → M23
- Interactive date picker component → M23
- Natural language parsing → Future

## [x] Milestone M22.1: Date API Refinement - Auto-Detection with Optional Override (v0.21.1)


## [x] Milestone M22.1: Date API Refinement - Auto-Detection with Optional Override (v0.21.1)
**Goal**: Refine the date API to establish clear conventions: auto-detection as the primary/recommended approach with explicit resolution override as an advanced option for edge cases.

**Status**: Complete. All implementation and documentation tasks finished.

**Context**: M22 Phase 5 implemented a hybrid approach keeping both flexible date parser (auto-detection) AND explicit resolution flags. M22.1 refines this by adding validation, improving documentation, and establishing clear conventions for when to use each approach.

#### Problem Statement
After M22 Phase 5, both approaches work but lack clear guidance:
- Auto-detection: `--start-date "2025-Q1"` (parser detects resolution: quarter)
- Explicit override: `--start-date "2025-01-01" --start-date-resolution quarter`

Users need guidance on:
- When to use auto-detection vs explicit flags
- What happens when both are provided
- Which approach is recommended

#### Solution
Keep both mechanisms BUT establish clear conventions and add validation:
1. **Auto-detection as primary** (95% of use cases)
2. **Explicit override for edge cases** (5% of use cases)
3. **Validation warnings** when format and flag conflict
4. **Improved documentation** explaining when to use each approach

#### Requirements
- Add validation utility to detect conflicts between format and explicit resolution
- Integrate validation in project create/update commands
- Update help text to emphasize auto-detection and explain when explicit override is needed
- Update README.md with clear conventions and examples
- No breaking changes - preserve all existing functionality

#### Out of Scope
- Removing explicit resolution flags (kept for edge cases)
- Changes to the date parser itself (already implemented in M22)
- Interactive date picker UI (deferred to M23)

### Tests & Tasks

**Phase 1: Validation Infrastructure (3 hours)**
- [x] [M22.1-T01] Create `validateResolutionOverride()` function in `src/lib/date-parser.ts`
- [x] [M22.1-T02] Add validation rules:
      - ALLOW: Auto-detected matches explicit (redundant but harmless)
      - ALLOW: ISO date + explicit resolution (legitimate use case)
      - WARN: Format implies resolution but explicit flag differs
      - INFO: No format-implied resolution, explicit used
- [x] [M22.1-T03] Integrate validation in `src/commands/project/create.tsx` (after date parsing)
- [x] [M22.1-T04] Integrate validation in `src/commands/project/update.ts` (after date parsing)

      - Add example: "--start-date 2025-01-15 --start-date-resolution quarter"
- [x] [M22.1-T08] Update `--target-date` and `--target-date-resolution` help text (create command)
- [x] [M22.1-T09] Update all date help text for project update command

**Phase 3: Documentation Updates (1 hour)**
- [x] [M22.1-T10] Update README.md "Date Resolution" section:
      - Add "Auto-Detection (Recommended)" subsection
      - Add "Explicit Override (Advanced)" subsection

      - Add validation warning examples
      - Add best practice recommendation
- [x] [M22.1-T11] Update MILESTONES.md to reflect hybrid approach (this file)

**Phase 4: Testing (Optional - existing tests still valid)**
- [ ] [M22.1-T12] Add organizational comments to `tests/scripts/test-project-create.sh`
      - Section 1: Auto-detection tests (primary)

      - Test ISO + explicit (expect info message)
      - Test redundant but matching (expect success, no warning)

### Deliverables
```bash
# ✅ Recommended: Auto-detection (primary approach)
$ linear-create proj create --title "Q1 Initiative" --start-date "2025-Q1"
📅 Start date: Q1 2025 (2025-01-01, resolution: quarter)
✅ Created project: Q1 Initiative

# ⚙️ Advanced: Explicit override (legitimate use case)
$ linear-create proj create --title "Mid-Jan Project" --start-date "2025-01-15" --start-date-resolution quarter
ℹ️  Using explicit resolution: quarter
📅 Start date: 2025-01-15 (resolution: quarter)
✅ Created project: Mid-Jan Project

# ⚠️ Warning: Conflicting format + flag
$ linear-create proj create --start-date "2025-Q1" --start-date-resolution month
⚠️  Warning: Date format '2025-Q1' implies quarter resolution, but --*-date-resolution
    is set to 'month'. Using explicit value (month).
📅 Start date: Q1 2025 (2025-01-01, resolution: month)

# 🔄 Update only: Resolution-only update (update command)
$ linear-create proj update myproject --start-date-resolution quarter
ℹ️  Updating resolution without changing date (resolution-only update)
✅ Updated project: myproject

# Help text emphasizes auto-detection:
$ linear-create project create --help
  --start-date <date>              Planned start date
                                   Formats: YYYY-MM-DD, Quarter (2025-Q1), Month (Jan 2025)
                                   Resolution auto-detected from format.
  --start-date-resolution <res>    Override auto-detected resolution (advanced)
                                   Only needed when date format doesn't match intent
                                   Example: --start-date 2025-01-15 --start-date-resolution quarter
```

### Automated Verification

- [x] `npm run typecheck` passes
- [x] `npm run lint` passes
- [x] `npm run test` passes (unit tests with validation utility tests)
- [ ] `tests/scripts/test-project-create.sh` passes (requires LINEAR_API_KEY)
- [ ] `tests/scripts/test-project-update.sh` passes (requires LINEAR_API_KEY)

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Auto-detection works without explicit flags (primary workflow)
- [ ] Explicit override works for mid-period dates
- [ ] Resolution-only updates work in update command
- [ ] Warning displays for conflicting format + flag
- [ ] Info message displays for ISO + explicit override
